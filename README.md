## 🔬 **How It Works**

1. **Startup & local LLM Setup**
   - Initializes a local Ollama model (`qwen3:1.7b`) via `ChatOllama`
   - Registers tools (`get_time`, `take_screenshot`, `matrix_mode`) using LangChain

2. **Wake Word Listening**
   - Listens via microphone (e.g., `device_index=0`)
   - If it hears the word **"Jarvis"**, it enters "conversation mode"

3. **Voice Command Handling**
   - Records the user’s spoken command
   - Passes the command to the LLM, which may invoke tools
   - Responds using `pyttsx3` text-to-speech (with optional custom voice)

4. **Timeout**
   - If the user is inactive for more than 30 seconds in conversation mode, it resets to wait for the wake word again.
